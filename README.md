# text-editor

## Description

This simple application was made to showcase my ever-growing knowledge and skills of initializing and executing a service worker within the app, as well as updating/retrieving information within the database. The first hurdle was completing the method functions to export the updated data, as well as receiving all the content. I referenced the PWA class activities for the syntax. Next was installing, initializing and executing the service worker to clear cache. I found that again, reviewing the class activities really helped guide me through this. Finally, I had to adjust the webpack.config.js as well as the root package.json.
